scope of project - 
reproduce results from paper?? and discuss them??
and then just think of some complications??

need one big result at the end or can be a collection of lots of little thinngs?

project question
how well can we use real time 2d fluid sim on sphere to qualitatively visualise features formation (like cloud shape, hurricanes, tornados? ( maybe tornados a bit too small) in the atmostphere

vorticity ? could sphere prevent irrotational fluid??

spin sphere, coriolis force????
convection segmentation (john brennan photo)

funny atmosphere things? (to google)

first make 2d fluid sim on square, introduce fun features like viscocity, compressibility as you go
- math into discrete version
- visaualisation

then move to 2d fluid on spherical surface, then to beggining of notepad
- math into spherical discrete verion
- visualisation

3d fluid in box then 3d  surface on sphere

machine learning in fluid dynamics, training approximating functions, might be too computationally expensive depending on if fluid is 2d or 3d, 3d will take ages.

what kind of want as a end goal is to have a collection of pretty simulations of fluids doing fluid stuff

jupiter storm on sphere, fluid sim more 3d time permitting
