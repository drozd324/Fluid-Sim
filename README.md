This repository originally started as an attemps to simulate fluids but its currently a compilation of finite element method scripts solving various pdes.

The "code in report" and "code - final" directories are mostly duplicates with some exceptions and are the most well documented and working code.

The "code" directory is the least clean but has all of the ideas i used to get the "code in report" and "code - final" working properly.
